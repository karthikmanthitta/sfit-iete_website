This was one of my first endeavours towards website designing. 
I was the Chair to one of the student branches at our college, named IETE(Institution of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineers). 
This was my simple attempt at building an information website for the said committee, presenting the various events and workshops we conducted as a team. The site also presents the members of the committee to the viewer.
Elements in the website:
Simple HTML
CSS style sheets
