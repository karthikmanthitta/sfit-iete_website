This was one of my first endeavours towards website designing.<br> 
I was the Chair to one of the student branches at our college, named IETE(Institution of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineers). <br>
This was my simple attempt at building an information website for the said committee, presenting the various events and workshops we conducted as a team. The site also presents the members of the committee to the viewer.<br>
<b>Elements in the website:</b>
<ul><li>Simple HTML</li>
  <li>CSS style sheets</li></ul>
